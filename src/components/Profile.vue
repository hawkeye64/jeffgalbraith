After all of the above and yu are still with me, you probably want to know a little bit more about me...

Hi, my name is Jeff Galbraith and I live in Calgary, Alberta CANADA. You may or may not have heard of [Calgary](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Calgary,+AB/@51.0272883,-114.3680132,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x537170039f843fd5:0x266d3bb1b652b63a!8m2!3d51.0447331!4d-114.0718831) before, but it is has been voted [5th most livable places to live in the world](https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/calgary-edges-out-vancouver-and-toronto-to-rank-as-worlds-fifth-most-liveable-city-the-economist) and I love it here. Granted, there has been several times in the Winter when we have been the coldest place on Earth with wind-chill reaching -45&#176;C to -50&#176;C. But, I don't let that dampen my spirits when working remotely in software development, at those temperatures, is considered the normal here. The summers are typically 22&#176;C to 26&#176;C and even then, we often see the +30&#176;C weather.

During the summer, we go camping -- a lot! Some consider it "glamping" (glorified camping) because we have a trailer and a lot of the time we go off-grid. You pull out to what's called "crown" or "public-use" land, after driving at least several hours, pick a spot, set up your fire and you're camping. Usually, so far remote from civilization there is no mobile services.

I currently work for a company called [IntelliView Technologies](https://intelliviewtech.com/). We build and deliver special dual cameras, along with AI and machine learning, to detect pipeline and gas leaks. It's quite fun and fascinating.

Before then, I have worked for several companies like Microsoft (twice), Honeywell, Vulcan and WildTangent. I spent 13 years living in the States so I can learn from others before returning home to Canada. I also spent 5 of those years teaching at [Bellevue Community College](https://www.bellevuecollege.edu/) writing and teaching course curriculum for C and C++.

Speaking of which, C/C++ had been my main languages since 1988, when I first started programming.

Now, I pretty much do web development. Lots of work with joy and fulfullment in my day-to-day life. I am also, what I call, a part-time Open-Sourcerer and have been on the Core Team of [Quasar Framework](https://github.com/quasarframework) since 2018.
